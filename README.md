# 🛰️ Autonomous AI Drones for Wildlife Monitoring (AirSim Simulation)

This project simulates an autonomous drone system equipped with AI-powered vision for wildlife monitoring, using Microsoft's AirSim and Unreal Engine. The primary objective is to develop a virtual testbed where drones can detect and track wildlife in real time within a synthetic environment, supporting conservation and anti-poaching efforts.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Simulate drone-based wildlife surveillance.
- Integrate YOLOv8 for animal detection.
- Enable autonomous navigation using AirSim APIs.
- Log and visualize detection results.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **AirSim** – For simulating drones in Unreal environments.
- **Unreal Engine** – Custom forest environment.
- **Python 3.11+** – Core programming language.
- **YOLOv8** – For object detection.
- **OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas** – For processing and analysis.
